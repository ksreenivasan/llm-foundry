What is postmodernism?
### Response:
[0mPostmodernism is a term used to describe a broad range of cultural, social, and political ideas and movements that emerged in the late 20th century. Postmodernism is characterized by a rejection of the modernist belief in progress and the idea that there is a single, objective truth. Instead, postmodernists emphasize the importance of multiple perspectives and the fluidity of meaning. Postmodernism has had a significant impact on contemporary culture, influencing fields such as art, literature, and politics.
